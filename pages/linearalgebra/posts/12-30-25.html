        <h1>What is a Linear Algebra?</h1>

        It seems that the study of Linear Algebra has to do with Linear Functions.
    <br>
        Now, then the question is what exactly Linear Functions are - which seems to be a slightly annoying question to answer.
    <br><br>
        <h2>Definition of Linear Function</h2>
        Per UC Davis [18], A Linear Function \(L\) is a function that satisfies:
        <ol>
            <li>Additivity: \(L(u + v) = L(u) + L(v)\)</li>
            <li>Homogeneity: \(L(c * u) = c * L(u)\)</li>
        </ol>

        For vectors \(u, v\), scalar \(c\), and operations \(+\) (Vector Addition), and \(*\) (Scalar Multiplication).
<br><br>
        Ignoring the tantalizingly interesting fact that Additivity is exactly the definition of a Homomorphism, we must further define what exactly a vector and scalar are.
        <br><br>
        <h3>What is a Scalar?</h3>
        A scalar is an element of a Field \(F\); which is a set that satisfies:
        <ol>
            <li>Commutativity of Addition: \(a + b = b + a\)</li>
            <li>Associativity of Addition: \((a + b) + c = a + (b + c)\)</li>
            <li>Existence of Additive Identity \(0\): \(a + 0 = a\)</li>
            <li>Existence of Additive Inverses: \(a + (-a) = 0\)</li>
            <li>Commutativity of Multiplication: \(a * b = b * a\)</li>
            <li>Associativity of Multiplication: \((a * b) * c = a * (b * c)\)</li>
            <li>Existence of Multiplicative Identity \(1\): \(a * 1 = a\)</li>
            <li>Existence of Non-Zero Multiplicative Inverses: \(a * (a^{-1}) = 1\)</li>
            <li>Distributivity: \(a * (b + c) = ab + ac\)</li>
            <li>\(0 \neq 1\)</li>
        </ol>
        \(\forall a,b,c \in F\), and binary operations \(+\) (Addition), and \(*\) (Multiplication)
        <br><br>
        <h3>What is a Vector?</h3>
        A vector is an element of a Vector Space \(V\); which is a set that satisfies:
        <ol>
            <li>Commutativity of Addition: \(u + v = v + u\)</li>
            <li>Associativity of Addition: \((u + v) + z = u + (v + z)\)</li>
            <li>Existence of Additive Identity \(0\): \(u + 0 = u\)</li>
            <li>Existence of Additive Inverses: \(u + (-u) = 0\)</li>
            <li>Existence of Multiplicative Identity \(1\): \(u * 1 = u\)</li>
            <li>Distributivity: \(c * (v + z) = cv + cz\)</li>
        </ol>
        \(\forall u,v,z \in V\), scalar \(c\), and operations \(+\) (Vector Addition), and \(*\) (Scalar Multiplication)
        <br><br>
        I could go on to define Vector Addition and Scalar Multiplication, but I would rather not (because I am lazy).
        More interesting to me is that a Vector Space seems to be a Group w.r.t Vector Addition with two additional constraints.
        <br><br>
        At this point I suppose I must have faith that Linear Functions as defined above are particularly useful in some way. I can gather
        that the majority of functions do not behave in this way because the majority of functions are not Homomorphisms
         and that Linear Functions are generally easier to work with than 
        non-Linear ones, so there is probably some utility in their simplicity.
        <br><br>
        <h3>Some easy results on Vector Spaces</h3>
        (Most proofs can be found in Linear Algebra Done Right(LADR) [14-16]):
        <ol>
            <li>Additive Identity (\(0\)) is Unique</li>
            <li>Additive Inverses are Unique</li>
            <li>\(a * 0 = 0\) for scalar \(a\) and the Zero Vector</li>
            <li>\((-1) * u = -u\) for vector \(u\)</li>
        </ol>
        There is an exercise that I find entertaining;
        <br>
        {LADR [16] Ex. 5}: Show that in the definition of a vector space, the additive inverse
        condition can be replaced with the condition that
        \[0v = 0, \forall v ∈ V.\]
        The proof is a reversal of the proof of (4) above;
        <br><br>
        <div class="proof">
            <h5>PROOF:</h5>
            Sufficient to prove \(0v = 0, \forall v \in V\) if and only if \(\forall v \in V.\exists (-v) \in V\) such that \( v + (-v) = 0\)
            <br><br>
            "\(\implies\)"
            <br>
            \(0v = 0 \implies (1 + (-1))v = 0\)
            <br>
            \(\implies 1v + -1v = 0\)
            <br>
            \(\implies v + -v = 0\)
            <br>
            Then there exists a \(-v\) for every \(v\) as desired.
            (Technically the fact that \(-v\) exists results from the definition of Scalar Multiplication which I have not given,
            but shhhhh don't mention that.)
            <br><br>
            "\(\impliedby\)"
            <br>
            \( v + (-v) = 0 \implies (1+(-1))v = 0\)
            <br>
            \(\implies 0v = 0\)
            <br>
            <h5>DONE</h5>
        </div>
        <br>
        I will be sure to use the fact that these two properties are interchangable whenever I need to confuse someone with a slightly
        unfamiliar definition of a Vector Space.
